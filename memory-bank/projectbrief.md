# IdeasFactory Project Brief

## Project Name

IdeasFactory

## Project Vision

IdeasFactory is an Agile AI-driven documentation tool for complex project development using specialized AI agents. It transforms abstract ideas into comprehensive implementation plans with detailed documentation, breaking down projects into granular, self-contained Stories grouped into Epics that AI developers can implement without additional context.

## Core Philosophy

**Each idea is inherently unique and must be preserved as such.**

IdeasFactory is fundamentally designed to preserve the unique innovative character of each project by:

- Avoiding any templates, guides, or hard-coded examples that could bias outputs
- Never forcing ideas into conventional implementation patterns
- Adapting our process to the unique characteristics of each idea
- Exploring the full spectrum of possibilities from established to experimental approaches
- Actively challenging assumptions that could limit innovation potential
- Treating the uniqueness of each idea as sacrosanct throughout the entire process

This zero-templating philosophy permeates every aspect of the system, from prompt design to agent implementation, ensuring that no idea's innovation potential is constrained by conventional thinking.

## Core Problem

Traditional AI-assisted software development struggles with maintaining integration integrity as projects grow in complexity. Ideas often get forced into conventional patterns, losing their innovative potential, while individual components lack the context necessary for seamless integration.

## Project Goals

1. Create a complete AI agent system that guides users from initial idea to implementation-ready documentation
2. Preserve the unique character and innovation potential of each project
3. Ensure seamless integration between independently implemented components
4. Produce self-contained developer packages that enable AI to implement features while maintaining system cohesion
5. Democratize software development by enabling non-technical users to bring ideas to life
6. Eliminate innovation bottlenecks by avoiding predetermined patterns and templates
7. Adapt the system's process to each unique idea, rather than forcing ideas into conventional molds

## Key Features

1. **Team of Specialized AI Agents**:

   - Business Analyst: Brainstorming and vision creation
   - Product Manager: Comprehensive requirements gathering
   - Architect: Technical research requirements and architecture design
   - Research Team: Multi-faceted, dimensional research across paradigms
   - Standards Engineer: Integration patterns and shared component standards
   - Product Owner: Granular task breakdown
   - Scrum Master: Self-contained story creation

2. **Enhanced Research Workflow**:

   - Multi-paradigm exploration from established to experimental approaches
   - Foundation-based research that preserves innovation potential
   - Dimensional research with parallel research teams
   - Cross-paradigm opportunity identification
   - Assumption-challenging questions that push beyond conventional thinking

3. **Zero-Templating Approach**:

   - No predetermined patterns, templates, or hard-coded examples
   - Open-minded exploration of unique solution spaces
   - Adapting to each idea's distinctive characteristics
   - Preservation of innovation potential throughout the process
   - Active resistance to defaulting to mainstream solutions

4. **Document Chain System**:

   - Structured progression of documents that build upon each other
   - Traceability from vision to implementation
   - Version control and document management
   - Preservation of unique characteristics across document transitions

5. **Developer Package Creation**:
   - Self-contained story documents with all implementation details
   - Integration guidelines from the Standards Engineer
   - Everything needed for AI-driven implementation
   - Maintenance of project uniqueness through to implementation

## Success Criteria

1. Non-technical users can turn ideas into comprehensive implementation plans
2. Each story document contains everything needed for implementation without additional context
3. Implemented components seamlessly integrate with each other
4. The unique innovative character of each project is preserved throughout the process
5. The system produces documentation of sufficient quality that AI developers can implement features without human intervention
6. The system never forces ideas into conventional patterns or limits innovation potential
7. Each project receives a tailored approach specific to its unique characteristics

## Project Boundaries

1. The system focuses on documentation and planning, not implementation (implementation is handled by external developer agents)
2. The system does not directly integrate with code repositories or development environments
3. The system is designed for use with AI agents, not as a traditional project management tool
