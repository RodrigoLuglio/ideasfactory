# IdeasFactory Project Progress

## Core Philosophy Status

Our foundational principle of preserving each idea's inherent uniqueness is being actively implemented throughout the system:

- **Zero-Templating Approach**: We're ensuring no templates, guides, or hard-coded examples are used that could bias outputs
- **Prompt Design**: All agent prompts are crafted to avoid introducing conventional biases
- **Research Framework**: The dimensional research approach explores the full spectrum from established to experimental
- **Decision Support**: Weighted criteria framework is designed to be adaptable to each project's unique characteristics
- **Documentation Generation**: All documents are generated specifically for each project, avoiding any one-size-fits-all approaches

This philosophy requires constant vigilance, as subtle biases can easily creep into system design. We actively review all components to ensure they adapt to each unique idea rather than forcing ideas into conventional patterns.

## Current Status Overview

IdeasFactory is in active development with the first phase of the multi-phase research approach implemented. The project is now working on implementing the foundation decision phase (Architect's second pass) with dual-path options based on user knowledge level.

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority

1. **Complete Architect (Second Pass)**:

   - Dual-path foundation decision interface
   - Research results presentation path
   - User-defined foundation explanation path
   - Generic foundation architecture document generation
   - Ensuring uniqueness preservation in both decision paths

2. **Implement Technology Research Team**:

   - Focused research on the selected foundation path
   - Technology stack options exploration
   - Technology compatibility analysis

3. **Cross-Document Integrity**: Maintaining references across documents in the multi-phase approach
4. **Session Management Scale**: Large projects with many documents can be unwieldy
5. **Innovation Preservation**: Subtle biases can creep in through prompt design and interface choices

### Conceptual Challenges

1. **User Knowledge Variability**: Accommodating users with different levels of technical expertise
2. **Decision Documentation**: Capturing user reasoning effectively, especially for predetermined choices
3. **Generic vs. Specific Architecture**: Finding the right level of detail for each architecture phase
4. **Research Depth vs. Decision Support**: Balancing comprehensive research with practical decision-making
5. **Uniqueness vs. Integration**: Preserving uniqueness while ensuring components integrate seamlessly
6. **Template Avoidance**: Creating adaptable processes without relying on templates or predefined patterns

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Workflow Refinements

- **Original**: Linear flow from Business Analyst to Developer

### Decision Process

- **Original**: Architect-driven technology selection
- **Current**: Dual-path options at decision points (research-based or user-defined)
- **Rationale**: Accommodates both users who want guidance and those who already have preferences
- **Innovation Impact**: Prevents forcing users with unique ideas into conventional research paths

### Architecture Definition

- **Original**: Single architecture phase
- **Current**: Three-pass approach with increasing specificity
