# Implementation Guidance for Enhanced Workflow

This document provides practical recommendations for implementing the enhanced IdeasFactory workflow, focusing on key technical considerations, agent interactions, and document flow.

## Agent Implementation Priorities

When implementing the enhanced workflow, prioritize these key elements for each agent:

### 1. Business Analyst (BA)
- **Current Status**: Well-implemented with good feature extraction
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Enhance structured data extraction (tracking suggestions/features)
  - Avoid bias toward specific implementations
  - Maintain focus on user's unique vision

### 2. Product Manager (PM) - NEW
- **Implementation Focus**:
  - Enhance the vision document with complete functional requirements
  - Add non-functional requirements section
  - Identify implicit technical needs
  - Ensure requirements are measurable and verifiable
  - Use a structured data model that captures each requirement type

### 3. Architect (First Pass) - MODIFIED
- **Implementation Focus**:
  - Create a multi-level research framework that emerges from the project's unique needs
  - Identify ALL technical requirements (explicit and implicit) needed for complete implementation
  - Establish a clear research hierarchy with foundational elements researched first
  - Map interdependency relationships between different research areas 
  - Show how foundational choices create branching paths for feature implementation
  - Direct full-spectrum exploration for each research area without naming specific technologies
  - Craft challenging questions that connect to the project's distinctive characteristics
  - Clearly separate responsibilities: Architect creates framework, Research Team identifies technologies
  - Ensure strict boundary discipline (only what's in requirements)

### 4. Research Team - NEW
- **Implementation Focus**:
  - Create specialized research agents with different search strategies
  - Implement result aggregation across research streams
  - Use structured output formats for consistent integration
  - Focus on depth rather than breadth in each domain

### 5. Architect (Final Pass)
- **Current Status**: Partially implemented but needs significant improvements
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Stricter boundary enforcement to match requirements
  - More comprehensive technology option presentation
  - Better decision tracking to ensure choices are reflected in documents
  - Enhanced interface and component specification

### 6. Standards Engineer - NEW
- **Implementation Focus**:
  - Pattern detection across architectural components
  - Cross-cutting concern identification
  - Reusable component specification
  - Integration guideline creation

### 7. Project Manager (Implementation Planning)
- **Current Status**: Planned but not implemented
- **Implementation Focus**:
  - Task breakdown logic
  - Document packaging
  - Dependency identification and management

## Document Models

Each document in the workflow should have a structured data model:

### 1. Vision Document
```python
class VisionDocument(BaseModel):
    project_name: str
    overview: str
    features: List[Feature]
    user_experience: Optional[str]
    scope_boundaries: ScopeBoundaries
```

### 2. Product Requirements Document
```python
class PRD(BaseModel):
    project_name: str
    functional_requirements: List[FunctionalRequirement]
    non_functional_requirements: List[NonFunctionalRequirement]
    user_stories: List[UserStory]
    constraints: List[Constraint]
    assumptions: List[Assumption]
```

### 3. Technical Research Requirements
```python
class TechnicalResearchRequirements(BaseModel):
    components: List[TechnicalComponent]
    research_questions: Dict[str, List[ResearchQuestion]]
    dependencies: List[ComponentDependency]
```

### 4. Research Documents
```python
class ResearchDocument(BaseModel):
    market_research: MarketResearch
    technical_research: Dict[str, List[TechnologyOption]]
    domain_research: DomainResearch
```

### 5. Architecture Document
```python
class ArchitectureDocument(BaseModel):
    functional_requirements: List[FunctionalRequirement]
    components: List[Component]
    technology_decisions: List[TechnologyDecision]
    interfaces: List[Interface]
    data_models: List[DataModel]
    deployment_architecture: DeploymentArchitecture
```

### 6. Standards and Patterns Document
```python
class StandardsDocument(BaseModel):
    coding_standards: List[CodingStandard]
    design_patterns: List[DesignPattern]
    reusable_components: List[ReusableComponent]
    integration_patterns: List[IntegrationPattern]
    testing_standards: List[TestingStandard]
```

### 7. Task List
```python
class TaskList(BaseModel):
    project_name: str
    tasks: List[Task]
    implementation_sequence: List[str]  # Task IDs in sequence
    prerequisites: Dict[str, List[str]]  # Task ID -> prerequisite task IDs
```

### 8. Epics/Stories Index
```python
class EpicsStoriesIndex(BaseModel):
    project_name: str
    epics: List[Epic]
    completion_status: Dict[str, bool]  # Story ID -> completion status
    dependencies: Dict[str, List[str]]  # Story ID -> dependent story IDs
```

### 9. Story Document
```python
class StoryDocument(BaseModel):
    epic_id: str
    story_id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    acceptance_criteria: List[str]
    related_requirements: List[FunctionalRequirement]
    technical_implementation: TechnicalImplementation
    context_information: ContextInformation
    dependencies: List[Dependency]
    standards_references: List[StandardReference]
```

## Session Management Considerations

The enhanced workflow requires modifications to the session management approach:

1. **Document Continuity**:
   - Ensure each agent can access previous documents in the chain
   - Implement versioning for documents that may be revised

2. **Session Model Extension**:
   - Each agent needs a specialized session model
   - Track decisions, questions, and feedback throughout the process

3. **Metadata Management**:
   - Store cross-document relationships
   - Track requirements-to-implementation mappings

4. **Document Storage Structure**:
   - Organize by session and document type
   - Support referencing across documents

## LLM Prompt Engineering Recommendations

For optimal agent performance:

1. **Avoid Bias**:
   - Remove examples of specific technologies in prompts
   - Use neutral language that doesn't suggest specific approaches

2. **Promote Comprehensive Thinking**:
   - Include explicit instructions to consider all aspects
   - Ask agents to validate their outputs for completeness

3. **Ensure Boundary Discipline**:
   - Include explicit scope checking steps in prompts
   - Remind agents to stay within the boundaries of prior documents

4. **Structure Output Format**:
   - Provide clear output templates
   - Use extraction validation to ensure structured data is captured

5. **Enable Revision**:
   - Design prompts to support document revision
   - Include self-critique steps before finalization

## Implementation Phases

The enhanced workflow can be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Workflow**
   - Implement BA → PM → Architect (First Pass)
   - Focus on document structure and flow

2. **Phase 2: Research Enhancement**
   - Implement Research Team components
   - Enhance search and information synthesis

3. **Phase 3: Final Architecture**
   - Implement Architect (Final Pass)
   - Connect research to architecture decisions

4. **Phase 4: Standards**
   - Implement Standards Engineer
   - Create cross-cutting patterns documentation

5. **Phase 5: Implementation Planning**
   - Implement Product Owner (Task Creation)
   - Implement Scrum Master (Story Organization)
   - Create deployment packages for AI development

## Model Selection Strategy

For optimal results while managing costs:

1. **Development Phase**:
   - Use GPT-4o for quick iteration
   - Test critical components with Claude Sonnet/Opus

2. **Production Phase**:
   - Use Claude Opus for Research and Architecture roles
   - Consider DeepSeek Coder for technical roles
   - GPT-4 for standards and document creation

3. **Optimization Phase**:
   - Analyze which steps benefit most from more capable models
   - Create a mixed model strategy based on role requirements
