# Architect's Second Pass: Foundation Selection and Generic Architecture

## Overview

The Architect's second pass occurs after the Research Team has completed their first-pass foundation research. This critical phase involves selecting a foundation approach and creating a technology-neutral generic architecture document that serves as the basis for the second research phase and guides all future implementation decisions while preserving the project's unique vision.

## Core Concepts

The Architect's second pass follows these key principles:

1. **Foundation-First Architecture**: Establishes the foundational approach before selecting specific technologies
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Provides users with detailed information about each foundation option
3. **User-Defined Flexibility**: Enables users to specify custom foundations beyond research findings
4. **Technology-Neutral Documentation**: Creates architecture documents that define boundaries without locking in specific technologies
5. **Preservation of Vision**: Maintains the project's unique character throughout architectural decisions
6. **Research Continuity**: Produces a foundation-based architecture document that serves as input for the second research phase

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Foundation Selection

The Architect must:

- Extract foundation options from the research report
- Present these options to the user in a clear, organized manner
- Provide detailed information about each option through an interactive chat interface
- Allow users to specify custom foundation approaches beyond what was researched
- Validate and refine user-defined foundations through guided conversations

### 2. Technology-Neutral Architecture Document

The architecture document should:

- Define clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Establish integration points between components
- Identify data flows and communication patterns
- Specify performance characteristics and constraints
- Avoid naming specific technologies where possible
- Focus on WHAT components need to do, not HOW they will do it

### 3. User Interaction Model

The interaction flow should:

- Present two clear paths: research-based or user-defined foundation
- For research-based: Allow users to explore options through interactive chat
- For user-defined: Guide users through a refinement process to create a complete foundation
- In both cases: Transform the selected foundation into a comprehensive architecture document
- Enable document review and revision based on user feedback

## Document Structure

The architecture document should include:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and architecture goals
2. **Foundation Approach**: Description of the selected foundation approach
3. **Component Architecture**: Breakdown of all system components and their responsibilities
4. **Integration Model**: How components communicate and share data
5. **Data Architecture**: Data structures, storage approaches, and access patterns
6. **Security Model**: Security boundaries and authentication/authorization approach
7. **Performance Considerations**: Expected performance characteristics and scalability approach
8. **Implementation Guidance**: General guidance for implementing each component
9. **Technology Selection Criteria**: Criteria for selecting specific technologies in the next phase

## Foundation Types

Common foundation approaches include:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Traditional separation between client and server components
2. **Microservices Architecture**: System composed of small, independent services
3. **Serverless Architecture**: Event-driven approach without dedicated server management
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Communication through events and message brokers
5. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Distributed nodes with equal responsibilities
6. **Edge Computing Architecture**: Processing close to data sources rather than centralized
7. **Hybrid Architecture**: Combination of multiple architectural patterns
8. **Custom Foundation**: User-defined approach tailored to project-specific needs

## Transition to Second Research Phase

After the generic architecture document is created, the process flows into the second research phase:

1. **Research Input**: The generic architecture document becomes the primary input for the second research phase
2. **Technology Focus**: The second research phase focuses on specific technologies rather than architectural approaches
3. **Component-Based Research**: Each component defined in the generic architecture is researched independently
4. **Integration Research**: Technology compatibility and integration points are thoroughly explored
5. **Evaluation Criteria**: Technologies are evaluated based on criteria defined in the generic architecture document
6. **Implementation Paths**: Multiple viable implementation paths are identified for each component

The Research Team will apply the same dimensional research approach but at a more concrete technology level, exploring:

- Database technologies
- Frontend frameworks
- Backend technologies
- Integration technologies
- Security implementations
- Performance optimization approaches
- Deployment and infrastructure options

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Informed Decision-Making**: Architecture informed by comprehensive research
2. **User Control**: Users maintain control over foundational architectural decisions
3. **Flexibility**: Architecture can adapt to different technology stacks
4. **Coherence**: Ensures all components work together as an integrated system
5. **Innovation Preservation**: Prevents mainstream patterns from diluting unique project aspects
6. **Progressive Refinement**: Allows for increasingly detailed decisions as knowledge increases
7. **Research Continuity**: Maintains consistent research methodology across multiple phases

By following this approach, the Architect creates a solid architectural foundation that guides implementation while preserving flexibility and the project's unique character. The resulting generic architecture document serves both as an architectural milestone and as the foundation for the technology-focused second research phase.
