# Architect's First Pass: Research Requirements Framework

## Overview

The Architect's first pass is a critical phase in the IdeasFactory workflow, serving as the bridge between product requirements and technical research. This document outlines the refined approach for creating research requirements that preserve innovation while providing clear guidance for the Research Team.

## Core Concepts

The Architect's first pass follows these key principles:

1. **Multi-Level Research Framework**: Creates a hierarchical approach to research with foundations first
2. **Complete Technical Requirements**: Identifies ALL aspects needed for full implementation
3. **Interdependency Mapping**: Shows how choices in one area affect options in others
4. **Full-Spectrum Exploration**: Directs research across established to experimental approaches
5. **Clear Role Separation**: Architect creates framework, Research Team identifies specific technologies

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Identify ALL Technical Requirements

The Architect must:
- Document EVERY technical need necessary for complete implementation
- Uncover both explicit requirements (mentioned in PRD) and implicit requirements
- Consider the entire implementation journey from foundation to user-facing features
- Focus on WHAT needs to be implemented, not HOW to implement it

### 2. Establish a Clear Research Hierarchy

The research framework should:
- Identify foundational technical requirements that must be researched FIRST
- Show how choices at the foundation level create different paths for feature implementation
- Establish clear dependencies between research areas
- Guide researchers to explore complete technological paths, not isolated components

### 3. Map Interdependency Relationships

The document must:
- Show how discoveries in foundational areas will shape exploration in dependent areas
- Create a network of interconnected research pathways rather than isolated topics
- Illustrate how decisions branch from foundational choices through implementation details
- Identify where different paths may converge or create novel integration opportunities

### 4. Direct Full-Spectrum Exploration

For each research area, guide exploration across:
- Established approaches (traditional, proven methodologies)
- Mainstream solutions (contemporary popular solutions)
- Cutting-edge technologies (emerging technologies gaining traction)
- Experimental approaches (research-stage approaches)
- Cross-domain combinations (novel combinations across different domains)
- First-principles solutions (custom approaches designed specifically for the project)

### 5. Craft Illuminating Questions

Include questions that:
- Challenge fundamental assumptions about how the project "should" be implemented
- Reveal possibilities that conventional thinking would overlook
- Connect directly to what makes the project distinctive and valuable
- Push exploration beyond the boundaries of established practice
- Encourage researchers to discover approaches uniquely suited to this specific project

### 6. Maintain Clear Role Separation

The document should:
- Avoid naming specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- Explicitly direct the Research Team to identify and evaluate specific technologies
- Make clear that the Research Team's primary responsibility is to discover ALL viable implementation options
- Provide structure (what to research and in what order) while enabling freedom (to discover specific options)

## Document Structure

The research requirements document should include:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and the research framework's purpose
2. **Technical Requirements**: Complete list of all aspects needing implementation
3. **Research Hierarchy**: Clear identification of foundational and dependent areas
4. **Interdependency Map**: Visual or textual representation of research area relationships
5. **Full-Spectrum Exploration Guidance**: Direction for exploring each area across the spectrum
6. **Illuminating Questions**: Challenging questions that push beyond conventional thinking
7. **Research Team Directives**: Clear instructions for the Research Team to identify specific technologies

## Key Distinctions

- **Architect's Role**: Create research framework without naming specific technologies
- **Research Team's Role**: Identify and evaluate specific technologies across the spectrum
- **Research Structure**: Multi-level approach with foundations first, then branching paths
- **Project Uniqueness**: Preserve the project's distinctive character throughout

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Comprehensive Exploration**: Ensures all technical aspects are thoroughly researched
2. **Path-Based Research**: Creates complete technological paths rather than isolated components
3. **Innovation Preservation**: Maintains what makes each project unique and distinctive
4. **Clear Guidance**: Provides both structure and freedom for the Research Team
5. **Implementation Integrity**: Ensures all decisions are informed by thorough, unbiased research

By following this approach, the Architect creates a research framework that enables the Research Team to discover the full range of implementation possibilities while preserving the project's unique character and innovative potential.
