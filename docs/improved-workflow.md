# Improved IdeasFactory Workflow

This document outlines the enhanced workflow for the IdeasFactory project, designed to create truly self-contained story packages that enable AI-driven development while maintaining integration integrity.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Vision Creation (Business Analyst)

- **Input**: Initial project idea
- **Process**: Brainstorming session with user
- **Output**: Project Vision Document
- **Purpose**: Capture the core concept, primary features, and unique value proposition

### 2. Detailed Requirements (Product Manager)

- **Input**: Project Vision Document
- **Process**: Expansion of vision into comprehensive requirements
- **Output**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- **Purpose**: Document complete functional and non-functional requirements, including implicit needs

### 3. Technical Research Requirements (Architect - First Pass)

- **Input**: PRD and Vision Document
- **Process**: Analysis of what technical components need investigation, with exploration across multiple paradigms
- **Output**: Technical Research Requirements Specification with multi-paradigm directives
- **Purpose**: Create targeted research questions for all technical aspects, spanning established, mainstream, cutting-edge, experimental, cross-paradigm, and first-principles approaches

### 4. Multi-faceted Research (Research Team)

- **Input**: Project Vision, PRD and Technical Research Requirements
- **Process**: New process to be implemented according to foundational-research-implementation.md document.
  - **Market Research**: Competitors, trends, user needs, unique opportunities
  - **Technical Research**: Foundational research across paradigms and dimentions
  - **Domain Research**: Field-specific insights and best practices
- **Output**: Comprehensive Research Document
- **Purpose**: Provide deep, unbiased, thorough exploration of all implementation possibilities while keeping maximum room for the innovation each idea might require or bring.

### 5. Architecture Design (Architect - Final Pass)

- **Input**: PRD and Research Documents
- **Process**: Technical design based on complete information
- **Output**: Architecture Document
- **Purpose**: Define the technical approach, component boundaries, and integration points

### 6. Standards and Patterns (Standards Engineer)

- **Input**: Architecture Document and Task List
- **Process**:
  - Cross-reference tasks to identify shared aspects and integration points
  - Define standards, patterns and interfaces that ensure complete integration
  - Identify and address potential integration gaps and duplication risks
  - Create concrete examples of proper component integration
- **Output**:
  - Comprehensive Standards and Patterns Document
  - Integration guidelines for shared components
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure seamless integration between independently implemented components
  - Prevent loose ends, inconsistencies, and duplication
  - Provide the "glue" that turns individual story implementations into a cohesive system

### 7. Task List Creation (Product Owner)

- **Input**: All previous documents
- **Process**: Breaking down implementation into granular tasks
- **Output**: Detailed Task List
- **Purpose**: Create a complete, sequential list of implementation steps

### 8. Story Creation (Scrum Master)

- **Input**: Task List, Standards Document, and all previous documents
- **Process**:
  - Organize tasks into logical user stories grouped by epics
  - Work closely with Standards Engineer to ensure integration completeness
  - Package each story with ALL information needed for implementation
  - Reference relevant sections of Standards Document for each story
  - Ensure every integration point is explicitly documented
- **Output**:
  - Epics/Stories index document with completion tracking
  - Individual self-contained story documents with integration references
  - Complete Developer Packages that combine story docs with relevant standards
- **Purpose**:
  - Create truly self-contained implementation units that an AI can implement
  - Ensure each story's implementation will integrate seamlessly with the rest
  - Enable independent development while maintaining system-level cohesion

## Document Chain

Each document builds on previous documents to ensure completeness and continuity:

1. **Vision Document** → Conceptual idea and key features
2. **PRD/Detailed Requirements** → Complete functional/non-functional requirements
3. **Technical Research Requirements** → What needs investigation to implement
4. **Comprehensive Research Documents** → Deep exploration of implementation options
5. **Architecture Document** → Technical approach and decisions
6. **Standards and Patterns** → Cross-cutting implementation guidance
7. **Task List** → Granular, sequenced implementation steps
8. **Epics/Stories Index** → Organized story tracking
9. **Story Documents** → Self-contained implementation units

## Critical Improvements

The key improvements in this workflow compared to the original approach:

1. **Addition of PRD step**: Ensures complete requirements, including implicit needs
2. **Split architecture into two phases**: Requirements identification then design
3. **Dimensional research exploration**: Research requirements that direct exploration across the full spectrum of approaches - from established to experimental, with emphasis on cross-paradigm combinations and first-principles innovation
4. **Enhanced integration focus**:
   - Standards Engineer specifically identifies shared aspects across tasks
   - Integration patterns define precise component interactions
   - Concrete examples of proper integration included in standards
   - Explicit cross-referencing between standards and story documents
5. **Developer Packages**:
   - Truly self-contained implementation units
   - Include all context needed for implementation
   - Explicit references to integration requirements
   - Combine story-specific content with relevant standards
   - Enable independent AI implementation while ensuring system cohesion

## Implementation Philosophy

This workflow embodies the core philosophy of IdeasFactory:

> Create truly self-contained packages for each project that include comprehensive requirements, standards, and architecture documentation to enable AI-driven implementation that maintains integration integrity as complexity grows.
